# Responsive Pretty Good Base Theme Orchard Theme



## About

Responsive PGBT is a responsive Orchard theme that aims to provide a set of common markup and styling so other themes can easily inherit from it.

The theme extends [Pretty Good Base Theme](https://github.com/Lombiq/Pretty-Good-Base-Theme) with responsive properties taken from [The Theme Machine Responsive](http://responsivetheme.codeplex.com/) theme so credit goes to the Planet Telex team!  
The theme is designed with the same aims as PGBT itself and can be used in the same way. Take a look at the [PGBT](https://github.com/Lombiq/Pretty-Good-Base-Theme) documentation for more info.

**The theme is dependent on [Pretty Good Base Theme](https://github.com/Lombiq/Pretty-Good-Base-Theme) so install it first!**
